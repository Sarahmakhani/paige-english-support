    <h2>Hi, I’m Paige 👋</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a 15-year-old student currently in secondary school, working towards top GCSE grades
      (including grade 9s). I offer <span class="highlight">KS3 subject and study skills support</span>
      for Year 7 and Year 8 students.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not a qualified teacher, and I don’t try to teach the full curriculum.
      Instead, I help students <span class="highlight">understand their work more clearly</span>,
      improve how they explain answers, and feel more confident using the knowledge they already have.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know that many students struggle not because they don’t try, but because they don’t always
      understand what teachers are looking for. My aim is to help students realise the potential
      they already have by breaking things down calmly and clearly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Subjects I Support</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>English</strong> – analysing quotes, improving paragraphs, explaining ideas clearly</li>
      <li><strong>Maths</strong> – understanding methods, fixing mistakes step-by-step</li>
      <li><strong>Science</strong> – understanding questions, explaining answers properly</li>
      <li><strong>History</strong> – structured answers, evidence, source questions</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Science</strong> – understanding concepts, logic, exam-style questions</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      Support is skills-based. I do not teach new curriculum content or replace school lessons.
    </p>

    <h2>How Sessions Work</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>The student brings schoolwork, homework, or a topic they are struggling with</li>
      <li>We focus on one area at a time to keep things clear and manageable</li>
      <li>I guide the student with questions, explanations, and practical tips</li>
      <li>The student leaves knowing what to improve and how to do it</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Sessions can be:
      <br>• One-off support
      <br>• Occasional help when needed
      <br>• Weekly sessions (if preferred by parents)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Students Need to Bring</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Schoolwork or homework they find difficult</li>
      <li>A topic they are currently studying</li>
      <li>A question they got wrong or don’t understand</li>
      <li>Teacher feedback they want help understanding</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      This helps sessions stay focused and avoids unnecessary lesson planning.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Free First Session</h2>

    <p>
      I offer a <span class="highlight">free “meet the student” session</span>.
      This short session helps me understand the student’s needs and decide how future sessions
      would work best.
    </p>

    <p>
      The free session allows parents and students to decide whether ongoing sessions would be helpful,
      before any paid tutoring begins.
    </p>
